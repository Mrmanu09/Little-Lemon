# Project Background
The Little Lemon Restaurant was in need for a new website with a table reservation system. The previous website had users confused about how to use it. Also, customers were previously unhappy with how the Little Lemon webpage looked and functioned. A way for customers to book a table with a chosen date and time was needed in a new and improved website.


The final build followed the high fidelity prototype. In order to better meet the project scope, the amount of pages in the reservation system were reduced. This reduction also helped condense and only require the form inputs neccessary.
